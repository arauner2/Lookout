# TroyHack2020
We created Lookout, an interactive website where students can learn about phishing scams and upvote the ones they've seen.

Phishing is the leading cause of data breaches, accounting for around 90% of them. For a mid-size company, the average cost of a phishing attack is $1.6 million. While there are tools to prevent the delivery of phishing emails to end users at universities and organizations, phishers are constantly evolving and many emails still get through. The best way to guard against the emails that slip through is through user education. 

Lookout is a platform for an IT department as well as students to submit the phishing emails that they are seeing. These emails are likely to be getting to other students on campus. When a student sees a suspicious email, they can check on Lookout to determine if it is in fact a phishing email. They can then upvote the entry to help the IT department determine how widespread certain phishing campaigns are as well as to make them more visible to students who are looking on Lookout.

Preventing against phishing attacks through user education provides a large financial benefit to businesses and universities. It can prevent the loss of funds as well as the loss of intellectual property or sensitive user data.

In the future, Lookout can be further integrated into a university's systems to make use of pre-existing authentication. This would prevent outside users from spamming Lookout's systems.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.
This project uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for components.
[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) was used for the database.

## Set Up
You will need to install node and npm. To check if you have these: run `node --version` and `npm --version.`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
